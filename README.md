# finite-size-effects
Repository for methods used to correct finite-size errors in quantum chemistry calculations with periodic boundary conditions. Jupyter notebooks with examples are included.

Prerequisites:
1. pyscf >= 2.7.0
2. numpy >= 1.26.3
3. scipy >= 1.13.1

Alternatively, one may create a new environment from `fs-effects-conda-env.yml`, and everything should work out of the box

```bash
conda env create -f fs-effects-conda-env.yml --name finite-size-effects
```
